# DataScience: Exploratory Data Analysis
PROBLEM STATEMENT - 
  One of the leading retail stores in the US, Walmart, would like to predict the sales and demand accurately. There are certain events and holidays which impact sales on each day. There are sales data available for 45 stores of Walmart.
  Walmart runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the largest of all, which are the Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. 
 
 In this project we did analysis of below points :
 -> Which store has maximum weekly sales in this dataset?
 -> Which store has maximum standard deviation i.e., the sales vary a lot. Also, find out the coefficient of variance (CoV)
 -> Which store/s has good quarterly growth rate in Q3â€™2012
 -> Some holidays have a negative impact on sales. Find out holidays which have higher sales than the mean sales in non-holiday season for all stores together
 -> Provide a Monthly,Quaterly and Semester view of sales in units and give insights
